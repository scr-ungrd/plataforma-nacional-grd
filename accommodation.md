You will stay in 4-bed dorms including breakfast at the [Generator Hostel](https://staygenerator.com/hostels/amsterdam?lang=en-GB) which is located in the beautiful [Oosterpark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oosterpark_(Amsterdam)). The workshop venue at the Amsterdam Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS) can be reached from the hostel walking (30min) or with tram 14 (15min). If you live in Amsterdam or close to it and would prefer to stay at home, that is perfectly possible of course. However, the registration fee for the school remains the same. This allows us to give out more waivers for participants who cannot afford the school.
