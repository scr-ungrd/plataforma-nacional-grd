    <p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Steinberger'>Julia Steinberger</a> travelled through physics and industrial ecology before landing as an ecological economist. As Professor of Societal Challenges of Climate Change at the University of Lausanne, she explores the relationship between energy use and social outcomes, how much energy is required for decent living, and how provisioning systems can deliver better outcomes with less energy. She was a recipient of a Leverhulme Research leadership Award for her research project <a href="https://lili.leeds.ac.uk/">'Living Well Within Limits'</a>, investigating how universal human well-being might be achieved within planetary boundaries, and currently co-leads the ERC Synergy Grant <a href="https://www.realpostgrowth.eu/">'REAL: A Post-growth Deal'</a>, advancing scientific research for realising post-growth transformations. Julia was Lead Author for the IPCC’s 6th Assessment Report with Working Group 3.
